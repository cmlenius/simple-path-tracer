      <h1> Simple Path Tracer </h1>
      <p>
        Path tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light for each pixel in
        the image plane while simulating various effects such as reflections and refractions of different surface
        materials

      <p>
        The Path Tracer itself is written in the fragment shader (glsl) and uses WebGL for realtime performance.
        In order to have realtime performance, upon rending an image the path tracer will use very few samples
        (hence the grainy look) and increase the samples used when the scene is still (no camera movement) thus
        creating a clean image. This is currently a work in progress as there are many features I would like to
        add to the current project such as being able to tweak the scene. I referenced "Ray tracing in one weekend"
        by Peter Shirley as a starting point.
